## 🛡️ Project Overview
**ZONBI** is a high-frequency **Threat Intelligence (TI)** feed that aggregates, cleans, and categorizes malicious indicators from multiple trusted sources including OpenPhish, URLHaus, and Phish.Database.

This repository provides daily-updated blocklists designed for security analysts, SOC teams, and network administrators to strengthen their defense infrastructure.

## 📊 Data Feeds
All data is processed and split into three specific formats to ensure compatibility with various security solutions:

| Category | Indicator Type | Direct Link | Primary Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **URLs** | Full Path | [🔗 urls.txt](urls.txt) | Proxy, EDR, SIEM Correlation |
| **Domains** | FQDN | [🔗 domains.txt](domains.txt) | DNS Sinkhole, Pi-hole, AdGuard |
| **IPs** | IPv4 | [🔗 ips.txt](ips.txt) | Firewall, IPS/IDS Blocklists |
